Epitech tek 1 project : Corewar

brief :

Implementation of CoreWar in C in groupe of 4 persons.
Divided in two parts : ASM and VM.
The asm part is in charge of the parsing of an assembler file and the generation of understandble code for the VM.
The VM hosts the fights between each champions from the code generated by the ASM parser.

To see the HTML docs file execute ./my_docs

The Makefile compile the 2 binary you can compile only the ASM in using the rule ASM and the VM with the rule corewar,
other rules can be used like : clean_asm, clean_corewar, fclean_asm, fclean_corewar, re_asm, re_corewar,
you can also find a Makefile in the directory asm and corewar with the rules : clean, fclean, re.

All the fonction are commented in there owne file.

The VM is in the corewar directory, and the asm can be find in the asm directory

VM :

Usage: corewar [-dump nbr_cycle] [-n prog_number] [-a load_address ] [prog_name] ...

It will host binaries that are
champions and provide a standard runtime environment. it provides
a whole bunch of useful features in battle of champions. Obviously
it must be able to run multiple programs at once (if not , fighting
not going to be exciting ... )

ASM :

Usage : ./asm [file to compil]

It will allow to write programs for a fight.
He will have to understand and generate assembly language programs
Binary understandable by the virtual machine.

You can find an exemple of file to compile in : ./champion

Bonus :

      -Makefile of control at the root.
      -Doxyfile.
      -Error and Notification are colored for an better comprension.
      -You can compile multifile in the asm.
      -The game.
      -Return (42);
      -All the code is documented.
      -This README.md
